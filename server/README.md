# Simple Server
A fundraising auction application.

## Requirements

- Install Node
    - on OSX, install [home brew](http://brew.sh/) and type `brew install node`
    - on Windows, use the installer available at [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/)

- Clone this repo

- Open a terminal (command line) window

## Quick Start
Run the application locally:

    $ npm install
    $ gulp serve

- `npm install` will install the required node libraries under `node_modules`.
- `gulp serve` will start the application. It is designed for an efficient development process. As you make changes to the code, the application will restart to reflect the changes immediately.
- `npm start` is a quick way to start the application in non-development mode.
